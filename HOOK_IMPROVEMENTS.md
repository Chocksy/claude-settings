# Claude Hooks Improvements

## Summary of Changes

Your `.claude/hooks` setup has been significantly improved based on the reference repository structure. Here are the key improvements made:

## 🔧 Major Fixes

### 1. **Session-Based Logging**
- **Before**: Used a single `tmp_last_event.json` file that could get corrupted or lost
- **After**: Uses session-based logging in `logs/sessions/{session_id}/` directories
- **Benefit**: Better organization, no file conflicts, easier debugging

### 2. **Simplified Notification Logic**
- **Before**: Complex notification logic with multiple managers and context aggregation
- **After**: Clean, simple notification system that focuses on reliability
- **Benefit**: More consistent notifications, fewer missed alerts

### 3. **Improved Stop Hook**
- **Before**: Complex summary building from temporary files
- **After**: Uses LLM-generated completion messages with proper fallbacks
- **Benefit**: More natural completion announcements, better reliability

### 4. **Better Error Handling**
- **Before**: Some hooks could fail silently or crash
- **After**: Comprehensive error handling with graceful fallbacks
- **Benefit**: Hooks continue working even when individual components fail

## 🚀 Key Improvements

### **Notification Hook (`notification.py`)**
- Now uses session-based logging
- Filters out generic "waiting for input" messages
- Cleaner TTS triggering logic
- 30% chance to include engineer name for personalization

### **Stop Hook (`stop.py`)**
- Uses LLM services (OpenAI/Anthropic) to generate natural completion messages
- Falls back to predefined messages if LLM fails
- Session-based logging
- Support for transcript copying with `--chat` flag

### **Post Tool Use Hook (`post_tool_use.py`)**
- Session-based logging instead of global temp files
- Maintains detailed tool execution information
- Better transcript integration

### **Pre Tool Use Hook (`pre_tool_use.py`)**
- Fixed syntax errors and malformed strings
- Session-based logging
- Maintains security checks for dangerous commands and .env files

### **Subagent Stop Hook (`subagent_stop.py`)**
- Session-based logging
- Consistent with other hooks' structure

## 📁 New File Structure

```
logs/
└── sessions/
    └── {session_id}/
        ├── notification.json
        ├── stop.json
        ├── post_tool_use.json
        ├── pre_tool_use.json
        ├── subagent_stop.json
        └── chat.json (when using --chat flag)
```

## 🔧 New Utilities

### **`utils/constants.py`**
- Centralized session management
- Consistent directory creation
- Easy session ID handling

## 🎯 Why Notifications Were Missing

The main issues with your previous setup:

1. **Complex Logic**: The notification system was trying to do too much context aggregation
2. **File Conflicts**: Single temp file could get corrupted or overwritten
3. **Missing Triggers**: Some completion scenarios weren't triggering notifications
4. **Error Propagation**: Failures in one part would break the entire notification chain

## ✅ What's Fixed

1. **Consistent Notifications**: Now reliably announces when tasks complete
2. **Better Organization**: Session-based logs are easier to debug
3. **Cleaner Code**: Simplified logic is more maintainable
4. **Proper Fallbacks**: System continues working even if individual components fail
5. **Natural Messages**: LLM-generated completion messages sound more natural

## 🧪 Testing

The hooks have been tested and are working correctly:
- Session-based logging is functional
- TTS integration works
- Error handling is robust
- All hooks exit cleanly

## 🎉 Result

You should now get consistent notifications when Claude completes tasks, including during planning phases. The system is more reliable and easier to debug when issues arise.

## 🔍 Debugging

If you need to debug issues:
1. Check `logs/sessions/{session_id}/` for detailed logs
2. Look for error messages in the hook outputs
3. Verify your API keys are set correctly (`ENGINEER_NAME`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`)
4. Test individual hooks manually using the commands shown above
